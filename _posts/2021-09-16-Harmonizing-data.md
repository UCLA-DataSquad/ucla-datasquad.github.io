Two Bruins – connected through the UCLA Library Data Science Center – collaborated to earn one of them a prestigious 2021 Undergraduate Research Week Dean’s Prize and the other hands-on professional experience in data science assistance.

<p>Dean’s Prize-winner Gabrielle Sones, recent communication studies graduate with a minor in music industry,
    hypothesized that the success of pop music artists is increasingly influenced by the social media activity of “stan”
    communities. A portmanteau of “stalker” and “fan,” stans are particularly active on Twitter. To support her thesis,
    Sones needed guidance mining the treasure-trove of available Twitter metrics.</p>
<p>“My faculty advisor Dr. Steven Peterson said it was my job to come up with a research question, and whatever that
    was, there were people at UCLA that could help me find out the answer,” said Sones.</p>
<p>Enter the UCLA <a href="/visit/locations/data-science-center">Library Data Science Center (DSC)</a> and fellow
    undergraduate, Julia Wood, a statistics major and the inaugural Norman Powell Data Infrastructure Assistant, named
    for donor Norman Powell, who is funding student data assistants for three years.</p>
<p>“Each new collaboration with a UCLA researcher enables me to develop new skills from data collection to
    visualization,” said Wood, who finds joy in learning the best technologies to help advance research teams towards
    their goals.</p>
<p>“Gabrielle came to the DSC with a very detailed research proposal,” said Wood. “It was crucial to narrow the project
    focus down to four artists, each with five stan accounts and five keywords so we could ensure we were collecting
    data which was accurate and standardized.”</p>
<p>Wood and Sones determined key data points to analyze for the artists Ariana Grande, BTS, Nicki Minaj, and Taylor
    Swift.</p>
<p>Wood then wrote code in Python to scrape key metrics such as follower count, retweets, and outbound link clicks, plus
    keywords including “buy” and “stream.” Analyzing this data in a program called SPSS Statistics, Sones found a clear
    correlation – but not causation – between stan Twitter communities’ efforts and artist success.</p>
<p>“The DSC’s main goal is to empower students and researchers to learn these tools and techniques to be able to
    comfortably work with data,” said DSC Facilitator Leigh Phan, who worked with Wood to set up software to collect
    stan account tweets.</p>
<p>“Gabrielle’s data-driven journey from thesis to consultation to award-winning project is emblematic of the DSC’s
    approach to de-mystifying data science.”</p>
