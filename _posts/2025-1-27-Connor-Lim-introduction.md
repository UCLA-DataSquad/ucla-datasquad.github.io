Here at the DSC, with the new year comes a new DataSquad Member.

Connor Lim is a 3rd-year Mechanical Engineering student from Danville, CA who will be joining us this year! He’s just returned from interning at Tesla last quarter, and specializes in 3-D printing, as well as opto-mechanical design!

Connor is currently a member of the UCLA Quantum Light Matter Cooperative, where he is helping create an electron beamline, a gun that shoots electrons at metal to release x-rays. This year, he’s looking forward to doing more research.

Along with doing more research, Connor is hoping to travel more and join more cultural clubs at UCLA. His fun fact is he can officially pole vault 12.5 feet, and he grew out of being allergic to milk.

In addition to our main services we provide at the DSC, Connor can assist with 3D data visualization and simulation.

We're thrilled to welcome Connor to the team, and can't wait to see the great work he'll contribute!
