Over the Summer and Fall quarter, Lukas Hager, a fourth-year Math of Computation student on the UCLA Datasquad, explored methodologies that could aid researchers in analyzing UCLA Library archives. One common method, [Optical Character Recognition (OCR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition), encompasses a broad group of technologies that uses pattern-matching algorithms to directly scan a document into a PDF with searchable text. UCLA archives contain texts from many years, mediums, and languages, whether it be from a political campaign image or an ancient transcription.  This work is especially helpful for making the content of scanned documents or images accessible for further analysis by UCLA researchers and collaborators.
